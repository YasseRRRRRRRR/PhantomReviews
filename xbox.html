                    <p><strong>Quantum break</strong><br>Quantum Break is a science fiction action-adventure
                        third-person shooter video game developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by Microsoft
                        Studios. The game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One in April 2016. The
                        game centers on Jack Joyce, granted time manipulation powers after a failed time-machine
                        experiment, as he comes into conflict with former friend Paul Serene over how to deal with an
                        apocalyptic "End of Time". In addition, the game includes platform game elements in less
                        action-oriented segments. There are also "junction points" that affect the game's outcome. The
                        game features episodes of an integrated live-action television show, featuring the actors of the
                        characters. The characters interact with the player's choices, displaying the results of the
                        decisions made.</p>
