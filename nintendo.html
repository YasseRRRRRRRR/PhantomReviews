                 <h1 style="color:#be1010;">Just Dance</h1>
                   <p>Just Dance is a motion-based dancing game for multiple players, with each game including a collection of classic and modern songs each with their own dance choreographies. During each song, players mirror a dance performed by actors on the screen, following commands that appear on the screen, and are awarded for their accuracy. Additionally, there are gold moves in which players must strike a pose in order to earn bonus points. Players are given ranks based on how well they do. Depending on the game and system it is played on, the game can be played with either motion controllers or camera devices (such as the Wii Remote and Kinect), or using an app downloaded on a smart device.</p>
